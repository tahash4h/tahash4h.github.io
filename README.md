# 📚 Book Finder WebApp – Demo

This is a **demo version** of the Book Finder website—a web application designed to help users discover new books, get personalized recommendations, read reviews, and explore curated lists.

This demo focuses on the homepage layout using basic HTML and CSS. It is a clean, responsive, and beginner-friendly foundation to build from. The current version is static and designed to visualize structure and style before adding advanced features like API integration.
